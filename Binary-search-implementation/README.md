BINARY Search is a sorting algoritm.
it works by  breaking down a sorted list
into half separated by a median.

checking if the search target is the median if it is return it. 
else if search target is less than the median value ignore the right values
and proceed to the right values.
if search target is greater than the median value ignore the left values.

this algorithm said to be a O(log(n))+c
